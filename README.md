# Expedia Project
The goal of the project is to implement a website with a subset of the functionality of tripadvisor (or oyster.com, hotels.com), where users can register, login, search for hotels, read reviews written by other people, write and edit their own reviews, etc. Note that this website will not allow the user to check availability or book hotels.
